        Currently pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE), I enjoy creating dynamic and interactive web applications.

        I've worked on a variety of projects, including a learning platform, a quiz app, and various interactive tools. My goal is to continuously 
        improve my skills and contribute to impactful projects.
